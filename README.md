The avr bare-metal fast-PWM for burning imitation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The researches have shown that candle has a 16 stages of burning by certain probability distribution.

More about researches [here](https://github.com/cpldcpu/CandleLEDhack).

The implementation of the random generation is based on [Linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator).
