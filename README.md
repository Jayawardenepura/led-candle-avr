The Algorithm of the imitation **burning candle** which is based on AVR Atmega 328/p
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The researches have shown that candle has a 16 stages of burning by certain probability distribution.

More about researches [here](https://github.com/cpldcpu/CandleLEDhack).

The implementation of the random generation is based on [Linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator).

### Run:
- make clean hex
- make flash

### Clean
- make clean
